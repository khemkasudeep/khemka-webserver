	functionalities implemented - 
	1. GET
	2. POST - 
		it accepts multipart post request as well. 
		In multipart request if you don't provide filename(in Content-Disposition), your file won't get uploaded.
		We assume that the request-uri provided by you in multipart post request is path where you want to upload your data.
		this path must be relative to www_root_path
		If this path don't/can't be exists/created, we try uploading in default upload location (denoted by - www_root_path/www_upload_path). 
		Notice that  www_upload_path is relative to www_root_path
		
		In non multipart request, we simple log the request.
		
		POST allows you to upload a file with the same name. Every time you send such file, it is uploaded with the name filename (index).extension, where
		index goes from 2 to 1024. Beyond this, another conventionis used which is UUID__filename.extension

	Known Issues
	1. In a request with trailing dots, dots are ignored. for e.g. Get http://server:port/index.html and http://server:port/index.html...  are equivalent
	2.
